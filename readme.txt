A privacy-first AI Site Reliability Engineer running entirely in the browser via WebLLM and the WordPress Abilities API.

== Description ==

WP Neural Admin transforms your WordPress admin panel into an intelligent command center. Instead of navigating through multiple screens to diagnose issues, you simply describe your problem in plain English.

= Features =

* **100% Local AI**: Uses WebLLM to run a Small Language Model directly in your browser via WebAssembly and WebGPU
* **Privacy-First**: No admin data ever leaves your device - GDPR compliant by design
* **Zero Server Costs**: No GPU infrastructure needed - computation happens on the client
* **WordPress Abilities API**: Natively integrates with WordPress's official Abilities API
* **Natural Language Interface**: Describe problems in plain English, get intelligent solutions

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.9+ (includes the Abilities API)
* PHP 8.2+
* Modern browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+)
